## Executive Summary

To deliver actionable crop recommendations with minimal farmer input, we propose a modular AI‑powered pipeline that ingests basic farm data and sensor or image inputs, runs specialized forecasting models (weather, soil moisture, pest forecasting, disease detection, and market pricing), and then surfaces the top 3–5 crop options via a generative AI prompt. Computationally intensive forecasting (weather, price) is hosted in the cloud, while real‑time inference tasks (soil quality from images, disease and pest detection) run on lightweight edge devices. This hybrid architecture minimizes latency for critical alerts and reduces cloud costs.

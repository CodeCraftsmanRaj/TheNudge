## 3. Dataset Information

The performance and reliability of the AI models heavily depend on the quality and relevance of the training data. The following datasets were utilized:

*   **Crop Prices:** Historical daily price time series for key crops (Jowar, Maize, Mango, Onion, Potato, Rice, Wheat) were aggregated from [**Placeholder: Specify Source, e.g., Government agricultural portals (APMCs), market data aggregators, specific commodity boards**]. Data cleaning involved handling missing values and standardizing formats.
*   **Weather Data:**
    *   **Historical:** Daily records corresponding to the price data locations were sourced, including parameters like maximum/minimum temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind speed. These were obtained via established meteorological data services.
    *   **Forecast:** Future weather projections (both short-term and seasonal) are essential inputs. While various sources exist, the system currently integrates forecasts derived from [**Placeholder: Briefly mention source type for prediction phase, e.g., standard numerical weather prediction model outputs, climate model ensembles**]. Advanced techniques involving models like PySteps or DGMR represent potential future enhancements for localized, high-resolution forecasting, though they are not the primary source in the current deployment.
*   **Soil Images:** A visual dataset comprising images categorized into distinct soil types (e.g., Alluvial, Black, Cinder, Clay, Laterite, Loamy, Peat, Red, Sandy, Yellow, Loam) was curated from [**Placeholder: Specify Source, e.g., Public image repositories like Kaggle, university agricultural databases, field surveys**]. A corresponding metadata file links images to their labels.
*   **Plant Disease Images:** A collection of leaf images for specific crops (Tomato, Potato, Corn) exhibiting characteristic symptoms of common diseases (Bacterial Spot, Early Blight, Common Rust) was assembled from [**Placeholder: Specify Source, e.g., The PlantVillage dataset, agricultural research institutions, annotated online image collections**]. Images were labeled according to plant and disease type.

## 4. Methodology and AI Components

This section delves into the technical approaches and rationale behind the core AI modules.

### 4.1 Weather Data Integration and Analysis

Weather is a fundamental driver of agricultural outcomes. This module focuses on acquiring and structuring relevant weather data for use by other AI components, particularly price prediction.

*   **Data Requirements:** Key parameters include daily maximum/minimum temperatures, precipitation totals, solar radiation (shortwave), wind speed, and general weather condition codes. Both historical records aligned with price data and future forecasts covering the prediction horizon are necessary.
*   **Processing:** Data is cleaned, standardized (units, names), and resampled to a consistent daily frequency. Missing values are imputed using appropriate methods (e.g., temporal filling for temperature, statistical defaults for radiation).
*   **Role in Pipeline:** Provides historical weather as *past covariates* for training time series models and future weather estimates as *future covariates* during the prediction phase. The quality of weather data directly impacts the accuracy of downstream models like price prediction.

### 4.2 Crop Price Prediction using N-BEATS

Predicting volatile crop prices helps farmers make informed decisions about planting and selling. The N-BEATS (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series Forecasting) model was selected for this task.

*   **Rationale:** N-BEATS is a deep learning model specifically designed for time series forecasting. It has shown strong performance on various benchmarks. Its architecture, based on backward and forward residual links and basis expansion, allows it to model complex patterns like trend and seasonality inherently. Crucially, its "generic" architecture variant readily incorporates external factors (covariates) like weather data, which significantly influence crop prices.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   **Input:** Historical daily price data for a specific crop (target series) and corresponding historical daily weather data (past covariates).
    *   **Preprocessing:** Both price and weather data are scaled (typically to a 0-1 range) before being fed into the model. This normalization is essential for stable neural network training. Scalers are saved to reverse the process after prediction.
    *   **Training:** The model learns patterns by looking back at a defined window of past data (`input_chunk_length`, e.g., 90 days) to predict a future window (`output_chunk_length`, e.g., 16 days). It's trained using an optimization algorithm (e.g., AdamW) to minimize a loss function like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between its predictions and the actual prices in the training set. A validation set is used to monitor performance and prevent overfitting, often employing techniques like learning rate scheduling and early stopping. The best performing model based on validation loss is saved.
    *   **Prediction:** To forecast future prices, the model requires the most recent historical price data (scaled) and *both* historical and *future* weather data (scaled) as covariates, extending across the desired forecast period (`N_DAYS_PREDICT`). The model then autoregressively generates the forecast, which is subsequently inverse-scaled back to the original price units.
*   **Output:** A time series forecast of daily prices for the specified crop and location over the prediction horizon.

### 4.3 Soil Classification using ResNet50

Understanding soil type is crucial for selecting appropriate crops and managing nutrients. A deep learning approach using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically ResNet50, was chosen for image-based soil classification.

*   **Rationale:** ResNet50 is a deep CNN architecture known for its effectiveness in image recognition tasks. Its residual connections help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, allowing for very deep networks. By using a ResNet50 model pre-trained on a large dataset like ImageNet, we leverage *transfer learning*. The pre-trained layers act as powerful generic feature extractors (detecting edges, textures, shapes), which can be adapted to the specific task of soil classification with relatively less training data and time compared to training from scratch.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   **Input:** Digital images of soil samples.
    *   **Preprocessing:** Images are resized to a consistent input size (e.g., 224x224 pixels, standard for ResNet). Normalization (adjusting pixel values to a standard range, often using ImageNet's mean and standard deviation) is applied. During training, *data augmentation* techniques (random flips, rotations, color jitter, cropping) are used to artificially increase the diversity of the training set and make the model more robust to variations in lighting and perspective.
    *   **Model Architecture:** The pre-trained ResNet50 base is used as a feature extractor. Its final classification layer is removed and replaced with a custom head suitable for the number of soil classes in our dataset. This head typically includes one or more fully connected layers with dropout (to prevent overfitting) and a final softmax layer to output probabilities for each soil class.
    *   **Training:** The model (often primarily the custom head, sometimes fine-tuning earlier layers) is trained on the labeled soil image dataset using a suitable loss function (e.g., Cross-Entropy Loss) and optimizer (e.g., AdamW). Validation data helps tune hyperparameters and select the best model checkpoint.
*   **Output:** Probabilities for each predefined soil class, with the highest probability indicating the predicted soil type.

### 4.4 Plant Disease Detection using CNN

Early detection of plant diseases can significantly reduce crop losses. This module uses a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify diseases from leaf images.

*   **Rationale:** CNNs excel at learning hierarchical patterns directly from pixel data, making them ideal for visual recognition tasks like identifying disease symptoms (lesions, spots, rusts) on plant leaves. Unlike traditional image processing, CNNs learn the relevant features automatically during training. While pre-trained models could be used, training a custom CNN allows tailoring the architecture specifically to the visual characteristics of the target diseases and available dataset.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   **Input:** Digital images of plant leaves (Tomato, Potato, Corn).
    *   **Preprocessing:** Similar to soil classification, images are resized (e.g., 256x256), and pixel values are normalized (e.g., scaled to 0-1). Data augmentation during training is vital to handle variations in lighting, angle, and symptom presentation.
    *   **Model Architecture:** A typical CNN architecture is employed, consisting of stacked `Conv2D` layers (using activation functions like ReLU to introduce non-linearity) and `MaxPooling2D` layers (to reduce spatial dimensions and provide some translation invariance). The convolutional layers extract increasingly complex features. These are followed by a `Flatten` layer and one or more `Dense` (fully connected) layers culminating in a `softmax` output layer that provides probabilities for each plant-disease class.
    *   **Training:** The model is trained on labeled leaf images using `categorical_crossentropy` loss and an optimizer like Adam. Performance is monitored on a validation set.
*   **Output:** Probabilities for each predefined plant-disease combination (e.g., 'Potato-Early_blight'), allowing identification of the most likely issue.

### 4.5 Crop Recommendation Engine [Placeholder]

This core component integrates insights from the specialized AI modules to provide tailored crop recommendations.

*   **Objective:** To suggest the most suitable crops for a farmer based on predicted weather, expected market prices, identified soil type, potential disease risks, and potentially other factors like subsidies and market access facilitated by the platform.
*   **Methodology:** [**Placeholder: This section will be detailed by the team member responsible for the recommendation engine. It should cover the logic (e.g., rule-based system, constraint satisfaction, ML model like collaborative filtering or reinforcement learning), the specific inputs used, how they are weighted/combined, and the nature of the output recommendations.**]
*   **Example Inputs:** Favorable long-term weather forecast, high predicted price for Maize, identified Loamy soil, low risk of common corn diseases.
*   **Example Output:** Recommendation: "Maize is highly recommended due to favorable price forecasts and suitability for your loamy soil. Expected weather patterns are also conducive. Monitor for [specific low-risk disease] as a precaution."

### 4.6 Output Summarization using LLM (Conceptual)

To ensure recommendations are easily understood, the final output can be processed by a Large Language Model (LLM).

*   **Rationale:** LLMs can synthesize complex data points and present them in natural, conversational language. This bridges the gap between quantitative model outputs and actionable advice for farmers who may not be data science experts.
*   **Process:** The structured recommendations and key supporting factors (e.g., "High price forecast for Wheat," "Soil type: Black," "Risk of Early Blight detected in Potato sample") from the recommendation engine are fed into an LLM (e.g., Gemma) via a carefully crafted prompt. The prompt instructs the LLM to generate a concise summary explaining the recommendations and the primary reasons behind them.
*   **Output:** A user-friendly text summary delivered through the application interface.
